Portfolio Website
I built a responsive website using React and Vite. I created this website to demonstrate my skills, make my resume more accessible and to become more experienced with current technology.

Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Vite
- React

Installation
Steps
- Clone the repository by running git clone
- Navigate to the project directory using cd
- Install dependencies. Vite and React, along with other dependencies, are defined in the package.json file. To install them, run npm install

Usage:
To start the development server with Vite, run npm run dev. This will launch the website locally.

Building for Production:
To create a production build using Vite, run npm run build. The files will be generated in the dist folder, ready for deployment.

Deployment
The site can be deployed to platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
